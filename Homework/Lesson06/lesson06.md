* a) CRUD. Make a simple web program, that allows multiple users modify the
  same data. Have user accounts and logins. You can use Django development
  server and admin interface here. Single table is enough. We already did a
  Customer (CRM) database, so it might be interesting to do something as
  simple, but slightly different.
  
  
  

  


  









  * b) Prod. Make a production style Django install. Use Apache and mod_wsgi,
    disable DEBUG.

Tips:

  * This is a challenging task, as there are many components
      - Do the smallest testable task
      - Know your goal. What test shows you're there?
      - Write the report while you're working.
  * When stuck
      - keep writing report while you work
      - list all your approaces taken
      - any hypothesis why it's (not) working like that?
      - list any sources you found and their recommendations
      - list any approaches you've discarded
      - sometimes it's good to stop for a while and summarize what you know
      - and take breaks
  * Yep, I noticed I wrote it in English, but it's done now and I don't want to
    write it again. Feel free to answer in Finnish or in English, which ever
    you prefer.
